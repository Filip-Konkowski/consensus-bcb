# Algorithm Solving Project Instructions

This is a Node.js TypeScript project designed for solving algorithms and coding challenges, featuring a distributed consensus algorithm.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Main source code
  - `simple-app.ts` - Express server entry point
  - `routes/` - API route handlers
  - `algorithms/` - Algorithm implementations
  - `consensus/` - Distributed consensus algorithm
- `tests/` - Test files
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output

## Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Write comprehensive tests for algorithm implementations
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use descriptive variable names and add comments for complex algorithms
- Prefer time and space efficient solutions
- Include time/space complexity analysis in comments

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all algorithm functions
- Include edge cases (empty arrays, single elements, etc.)
- Test both positive and negative scenarios

## API Development
- Create RESTful endpoints for algorithm demonstrations
- Include proper error handling and input validation
- Return structured responses with input, output, and algorithm information

## Common Algorithm Categories to Implement
- Sorting (bubble, quick, merge, heap sort)
- Searching (binary, linear, depth-first, breadth-first)
- Dynamic Programming (fibonacci, knapsack, longest subsequence)
- Graph Algorithms (shortest path, minimum spanning tree)
- String Manipulation (palindromes, anagrams, pattern matching)
- Array/List Problems (two pointers, sliding window)
- Tree/Binary Tree Problems (traversals, balanced trees)
- Hash Table Problems
